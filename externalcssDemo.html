        <h1>informatiom abuot Ganesha</h1>
        <p>
            Ganesha is the son of Shiva and Parvati and he is the brother of Karthikeya (or Subrahmanya), the god of war. <br>
            He was created by his mother using earth which she moulded into the shape of a boy.<br>
             As Shiva was away on his meditative wanderings, Parvati set her new son as guard while she bathed.
